This is a simple blog site I created for my Enterprise Data Administration final project at Niagara College.  The site isn't very fleshed out but still has some interesting features.

### Tools and Technology Implemented
The underlying development language used for this web application is Python.  The Python connects to a MongoDB Database using [PyMongo](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/) to perform transactions.  The [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) ultra light template engine is used to display the webpages.
